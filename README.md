### Spotbugs Issue #1518
[False negatives on RV_01_TO_INT](https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/issues/1518)

**Assigned to:** xinp2@
  
**Reason for choosing this issue:** The Spotbugs project looks very useful to me. Since this issue seemed to have a false negative case, I thought this might be an good start to get familiar with the code base.

**Progress summary:**
For the first a few weeks, I was struggled with my computer set up. I was using Windows and it was not very convenient for coding.
